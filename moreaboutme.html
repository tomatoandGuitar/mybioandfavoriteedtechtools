		<h2>More about me</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone! Thank you for visiting my page. I will keep updating on more useful educational technology tools I found.</p>
        <p>besides what I have posted on my bio page, I also likes some non-education technology focused websites that is helpful in student teaching. When building your own classroom(real or virtually), <a>href=https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/>Teachers pay Teachers</a> is a very helpful website.</p>
		<p>Buiding a virtual classroom is one trending topic in the past two years, and having more online resources in hand is generally better for teachers to help their students.</p>
